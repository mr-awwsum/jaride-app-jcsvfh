Here's the plan:\n\n**Acknowledging the User's Request:**\n\nYou've requested the creation of a \"Jamaica Uber app.\" This implies a ride-hailing application tailored for use in Jamaica, similar in functionality to Uber.\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the core features to include in the initial version:\n\n-   **User Authentication:** Implement a secure login/sign-up system.\n-   **Map Integration:** Integrate a map view (e.g., using `react-native-maps`) to display the user's location, available drivers, and allow users to set pickup and drop-off locations.\n-   **Ride Request and Matching:** Enable users to request rides, calculate estimated fares, and match them with available drivers.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\nHere's a vision for the app's design:\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Base color: A vibrant green to reflect the Jamaican flag and landscape.\n    -   Primary text color: Dark gray or black for readability.\n    -   Accent colors: Yellow and black, also inspired by the Jamaican flag, to highlight interactive elements and important information.\n-   **Typography:**\n    -   Use a modern, clean font like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a user-friendly experience.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** No changes needed.\n2.  **Implement User Authentication:**\n    *   Create a new screen for login/sign-up.\n    *   Add input fields for email/phone number and password.\n    *   Add buttons for login and sign-up.\n3.  **Integrate Map View:**\n    *   Install `react-native-maps`.\n    *   Create a new component for the map view.\n    *   Display the user's current location on the map.\n    *   Add functionality to set pickup and drop-off locations.\n4.  **Implement Ride Request and Matching:**\n    *   Create a UI for requesting a ride, including options for selecting ride type and viewing estimated fare.\n    *   Implement logic to match users with available drivers (this part would ideally be handled by a backend service).\n5.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Ensure seamless navigation between the home screen, login/sign-up screen, and map view.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-29T23:09:01.215753"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a Jamaica Uber app!
